## How I Built (and Broke) My Site So You Don't Have To

After putting it off for way too long, I finally built a new portfolio from scratch‚Äîand I did it my way. No templates, no Squarespace, no Framer. Just me, some helpful AI tools, and a whole lot of spaghetti code. This post breaks down how I did it, what worked (and didn't), and how you can follow a similar process‚Äîespecially if you're not a dev.

![Old vs. new site](/images/blogs/vibe-coding-portfolio/old-new-site.jpg)

I held off on rebuilding my site for a while‚Äîpart stubbornness about my design philosophy (minimal, fast, non-intrusive) and part not wanting to give up control using a no-code builder. But I knew my old site wasn't working. It wasn't getting callbacks. It didn't feel like *me*‚Äîand it wasn't built for *hiring managers*.

## Tools I Actually Used

![Testing tools](/images/blogs/vibe-coding-portfolio/create-vs-bolt.jpg)

Before landing on the stack I liked, I tried every trending tool. These are the ones I stuck with:

* **ChatGPT** ‚Äì to read through docs and help troubleshoot
* **Figma** ‚Äì to A/B test visual directions and layouts
* **Cursor** ‚Äì to get precise control and iterate with code
* **Create.xyz** ‚Äì used once to convert my Figma layout into base site structure
* **Visual Studio Code** ‚Äì manual edits and organization
* **Kap** ‚Äì for recording demos and micro-interactions
* **FFmpeg** ‚Äì to convert heavy GIFs into optimized WebP

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Start with content, not code**  
   The hardest part wasn't technical‚Äîit was *gathering the story*. I pulled together research plans, decks, designs, and deliverables.

2. **Create a visual highlight reel**
   I prototyped my top projects in Figma and used videos like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emSv9TTHZVY) for structure.

3. **Make a full presentation version**
   I created a pitch-deck style walkthrough for each case study after creating all the "flashy images" in my highlight reel. I used [Pitch](https://pitch.com/) for inspiration. This will be for the interviews, but better just to do them at the same time.

4. **Prototype the site with Create.xyz**
   I gave it a screenshot of my homepage and it gave back code. Great start‚Äîbut bulky, uneditable, and impossible to add my custom content. I also hated that I needed to be online for this. Do it on your local computer, you can test on your phone too.

5. **Move code into Cursor**
   I manually broke apart the giant file into usable chunks. Ask for the best practice for folder structure, then piece-by-piece seperate the code. There will be a lot of bugs here. Work in small sections, if your layout has a 3 x 3 grid image. Screenshot image and ask for that. It won't be able to help with a full layout.

6. **Customize every interaction**  
   Once I had a working site, I added scroll behavior, built a working table of contents, added dark mode, etc. Stuff that would've been annoying to prototype within Figma.

7. **Deploy**
   Have it help you connect and deploy your site depending on the type site you have. Have ChatGPT walk you through setting up the hosting and changing custom domain.

8. **Optimize**

   * Converted images to Webp for better performance
   * Resolved errors in the inspection console, I just add it in and slowley removed an errors
   * Debugged layout issues with good prompting

## Developer Things That Tripped Me Up
These are the things an actual a developer would have told me "that's not the right solution, here's a better way to do it". But AI will just do as it's told.

* I tried GitHub Pages first. Nope. Learned it only works for static Jekyll sites. If you ask the AI something, even if it's not best practice it will do it. **Remember to Google it too sometimes**. Switched to Vercel. 
* It kept offering to write scripts from scratch, for example to change gifs to webp, a lot of times someone has solved it much better, just use their implementation. I used gifs because it worked on the free plan for Figma, but now I know I should have a mp4 version too for the web.
* Flash errors for dark mode handling, this is a distinct issue from building a site that is server-side rendering, I've only done static site so that was never an issue
* I ignored the inspect view on my site for a while, and when I completed everything, it was really slow - I then had to figure why it was slow and learned about LCP - I had a 15 mb banner which was bad.
* Managing layout bugs, like fixing overlapping elements
* Understanding flex behavior, hydration errors, and deployment pipelines
* Getting components to be reusable across projects
* I probally could have been more lazy like a true developer. If I decide tomorrow to update my dark mode, I know I'll need to change it in a lot of places. Oddly Cursor doesn't do well for tasks like this.

## Moments That Felt Like Magic ‚ú®

* Adding a toggle button via prompt‚Äîworked first try
* Never writing a single line of React code and getting a usuable site on  my local computer in a day
* Fixing scroll-to-anchor behavior for my table of contents
* Cursor reading file structure and helping with breaking out the code
* Debugging felt much easier, but I also started to learn how to read the errors
---

## Constraints You Should Know

* **Writing and organizing** all the content (you can't automate storytelling)
* **Lots of manually importing text and photos**, I couldn't get it to just automatically add the text I want, but that's the nature of it being generative
* **Prompt engineering is a skill** the better you are at it, the better the output will be, don't blindly just accept the output

## Final Advice
![Tips!](/images/blogs/vibe-coding-portfolio/tips.jpg)

Start small. Break it down. Work like you would if you were building components for a design system in Figma. Use AI as a tool, you still need to guide it to tell the story you want, but the zeros and ones? That part's a little more human readable. Good luck on making your portfolio!
