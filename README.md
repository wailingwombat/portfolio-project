# Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website built with Next.js and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Deployment

This site is deployed to Vercel and uses a custom domain (annanguyen.design).

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the code in `src`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
